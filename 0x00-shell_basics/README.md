  - The listing should be alpha ordered, except for the directories. and .. which should be listed at the very beginning
  - Only digits and letters are used to sort; Digits should come first
  - You can assume that all the files we will test with will have at least one letter or one digit
  - The listing should end with a new line
 - `school.mgc` - Create a magic file `school.mgc` that can be used with the command file to detect `School` data files. `School` data files always contain the string `SCHOOL` at offset 0.
